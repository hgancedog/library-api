# Library Management System API

This project is an evolutionary backend development journey. It starts from basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) fundamentals and scales up to a distributed microservices architecture deployed in the cloud.

The main objective is to demonstrate professional growth, architectural patterns, and the adoption of industry-standard technologies like **FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Kubernetes**.

## 🚀 Project Roadmap & Evolution

The project is organized into sequential stages. Each stage is hosted in its own dedicated branch to showcase the transition between different architectural levels.

| Stage                    | Branch                 | Version | Key Technologies          |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------- | :------ | :------------------------ |
| **1. Fundamentals**      | `stage1-inmemory`      | `v1.0`  | Python, FastAPI, Git      |
| **2. Basic Persistence** | `stage2-sqlite`        | `v2.0`  | SQLite, SQLAlchemy        |
| **3. Professional DBs**  | `stage3-postgres`      | `v3.0`  | PostgreSQL, MongoDB       |
| **4. Dockerization**     | `stage4-docker`        | `v4.0`  | Docker, Docker Compose    |
| **5. Microservices**     | `stage5-microservices` | `v5.0`  | FastAPI, Redis/RabbitMQ   |
